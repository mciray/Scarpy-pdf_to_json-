Abstract Peop le have learned and has been developing agriculture for years. The surrounding land has become the best way to use as a resul t of years of observations. Over the centuries, cities have grown significantly and observable changes in land usage come up with the help of expanded and developing technology. Although Turkey has a huge and suitable land for agriculture, agricultural activities are gradually decreasing every year. The main reason why people of rural areas migrate rapidly to the cities and why agricu ltural activities are decreasing can be explained with the lack of adequate productivity in the production layer; moreover, fertile soils are n ot used effectively. As a result of the low level of productivity on agriculture, the production of agricultural products does not meet domestic demand. A significant amount of funding is planned for future agriculture projects. Nevertheless, agricultural development in Turkey is still facing major obstacles due to efficiency. Currently, significant inflation rate in crease in Turkey can be observed due to economical and geopolitical events. One of the most important reasons for the serious increase in inflation is the efficiency problems in ag ricultural items and activities. This study aims to develop a detailed risk analysis model of the whole system to increase productivity and efficiency with multi -criteria decision -making methods (MCDM). The findings obtained are an analysis of in agricultural productivity in order to make an improvement and it is important to be a preliminary study of the steps to be taken for efficiency. At the end of the study proposed risk analysis model aims to help all kinds of agricultural products to be planned and to be produced with detailed s cientific investigations .

There is a close link between d ominant winds and the sea because they bring the north and south under the influence of climatic features with Turkey landform features. Turkey has 77.9 million hectares of la nd assets. 26.3 million of it agricultural lands. Turkey's growing population and agricultural land features indicates that productivity is a key element to be considered. The variety of agricultural products and their yields can be increased with the usag e of valid and proper optimization and planning. Agriculture and food policies are effective in the development and implementation of new technologies and new planning strategies . Nowadays, o ne of the most important reasons for the increasing inflation rate is it the price increase in agricultural products . Agricultural value added constitutes 3% to 6% of the world GDP according to different approaches . It is known that this rate has decreased less than %10 which should be increased for the benefit of Tur key. Agriculture in Turkey has been developed for more than 90 years . Agricultural production potential can still satisfy the domestic agricultural demand although the system has several impediments. Figure 1 shows most produced commodities of Turkey for 2 3 year period. Although there is a significant increase can be observed, the price of agricultural products tends to increase. This makes productivity and planning problem that Turkey has been facing. Figure 1. Most produced commodities with respect to year period between 1994 -2016 In Figure 2 one of the most important agricultural product, rice production of Turkey can be observed. In Figure 3 top ten pr oducers of rice are shown. Almost half of the total production of the rice produced by China. Food a nd non -alcoholic beverages are at the rate of 23% in the inflation basket and they are the most effective group in calculation of inflation rate . Productivity in agricultural products is one of the most important indicator. Avrupa Bilim ve Teknoloji Dergisi e-ISSN: 2148 -2683 502 Figure 2. Rice production q uantity of Turkey with respect to year period between 1994 -2016 Figure 2 indicates obvious positive trend between time and total amount of production with the increase in population in Turk ey. Especially in year period 2003 -2006 it can be observed that po sitive linear increase existed. Figure 3. Top 10 producers of rice with respect to year period between 1994 -2016 In Table 1 it can be shown that although Turkey has 20 times larger agricultural land than the Netherlands, agricultural goods export is ap proximately 5 times less. In 2017 the Neth erlands exported €91.7 billion in agricultural goods while Turkey exported approximately €16 billion. When it is compared the total population between Netherland and Turkey it can be seen that Netherlands has a population of 17 million while Turkey has app roximately 80 millon. Turkey has relatively large agricultural land when it is compared with all of the European Union . In order to increase productivity in agricultural products, the detailed risk analysis is required for any process of product ion. Ther e are many risk analysis studies exist in the literature where Gul and Guneri (2016) has used benefit of fuzzy logic with the a pplication in Analytic Hierarchy Process to determine weights of criteria with the aim of prioritization of the alternative group s in manufacturing. On the other study Ebrahimnejad et al (2010) used MCDM methods to identificate risks with the help of fuzzy logic while Vahda ni et al (2015) used parameters of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to determine the preference of caus e failures.

The risk is the inability to achieve a targeted result, loss or damage over a period of time. Turkish agricultural studies indicate sign ificant risks due to efficiency problems. In order to minimize this possibility, economic and related risks are determined by risk analysis, and the scales of these risks and the areas to be taken are determined. Risk management is the process of iden tifying, controlling, eliminating, or minimizing uncertain events that may affect system resources. Risk assessment process requires and contains necessary actions are taken without delay for undesired trends or results. The importance of the issue in the manag ement of the Turkish agriculture will be examined with a content that provides practical solutions and explains how it can identify and meditate thei r risks. Risk assessment studies gives an opportunity to identify potential hazards for the general system and indicate the significant and base problems of it. It also indicates the factors that effect the agricultural system and gives proactive measures in order to de al with problems. 2. Method 2.1. Multi Criteria Decision Making Methods In this study, multi criteria decision making based model has been proposed with the most important indicators to be considered. First of all, organization and planning of cultivable lands for whole suitable agricultural lands of Turkey is needed. Optimi zation and selection o f which agricultural products have to be produced with the concern of value added. Agricultural lands should be divided groups according to domestic and global demands. Systematic approach should be applied to agricultural goods especially for p otential value added products. Decreasing import amounts of agricultural products in which Turkey has paid more money is one of the main objectives. 2.1.1 . Analytic hierarchy process Analytic hierarchy process ( AHP) model can be used in agricultural risk analysis with considering main objectives of Turkey. Thomas L. Saaty developed AHP in 1980 as a measurement theory of intangible criteria (Aragon_es -Beltr_an et al. 2009). AHP exposes relevant priority vector when interpreting information preferred by decision makers based on a set of pairwise comparison values of objects . The AHP is based on the hierarchical structure and it is a kind of MCDM method. Goal, criteria and alternatives are 3 important elements of AHP. Goal shows the aim of the problem. Criteria is proble m related elements that can be used for decision process. Saaty’s scale of 1–9 has been used for each hierarchical level and pairwise comparisons are made with judgments using numerical values . AHP has a ability to evaluate h ierarchical structure.as a wh ole of both quanti tative and qualitative criteria. The pair wise comparisons are organized in a matrix and priorities are derived from the matrix as its principal eigenvector. Consistency of decision makers can be checked in AHP with the help of consistenc y ratio(CR). 0.1 value is the maximum limit to ensure that judgment is adequately done. Steps of AHP are shown below: (Guneri et al. 2015; Tzeng and Huang 2011): Avrupa Bilim ve Teknoloji Dergisi e-ISSN: 2148 -2683 504 Step 1: Definition of problem and identifying target of problem Step 2: Criteria, sub -criteri a and alternatives are determined by creating hierarchical structure . Step 3 : Pairwise comparison matrix is created with respect to experts Step 4 : Computation of λmax(average ) of values from previous step. Step 5: Computation of consistency i ndex, CI = ( λmax - n)/(n - 1) . n : total number of items being compared. Step 6 : Estimation of CR and CI and obtaining random index ( RI) 2.1.1 . VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje VIKOR (the VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) i s one of the most common MCDM methods developed by Opricovic (1998) for multi -criteria optim ization problems and compromise solutions. Ranking of alternatives and determination of compromise solution can be done with VIKOR. Solution shows the “ideal ” which means closest to the optimal solution. This method focuses on selecting and sorting alternatives when there are conflicting criteria. The multi -criteria decision based on the basis of the proximity to the ideal solution “is also defined as the ranking ind ex. VIKOR method steps are shown below: Step 1: Creating alternatives and determining criteria Step 2: Create a decision matrix: where 𝐴𝑖represents ith alternative, 𝑖=1,2,3,…𝑚; 𝐶𝑥𝑗 : jth criterion, j =1, 2,..n; and 𝑥𝑖𝑗 separate performa nce of an alternative . Step 3: The normalization step as follows: 𝐹= [𝑓𝑖𝑗]𝑚×𝑛 Here, 𝑓𝑖𝑗=𝑥𝑖𝑗√∑𝑥𝑖𝑗2𝑚𝑖=1, 𝑖=1,2,3,…𝑚; 𝑥𝑖𝑗 : performance of 𝐴𝑖 with respect to the jth criterion. Step 4: Determination of the best and worst values of all criterion functions 𝑗=1,2,,…𝑛. If the jth function represents a benefit then: 𝑓𝑗∗=max𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑗 , 𝑓𝑗−=min𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑗 Step 5 : Estimation of utility measure (S) and regret measure (R): S and R for each alternative are calculated as : 𝑺𝒊𝒋=𝒘𝒋(𝒇𝒋∗−𝒇𝒊𝒋)(𝒇𝒋∗−𝒇𝒋−) , 𝑺𝒊=∑𝒘𝒋(𝒇𝒋∗−𝒇𝒊𝒋)(𝒇𝒋∗−𝒇𝒋−)𝒏𝒋=𝟏 𝑅𝑖=max𝑗(𝑆𝑖𝑗)=max𝑗( 𝑤𝑗(𝑓𝑗∗−𝑓𝑖𝑗)(𝑓𝑗∗−𝑓𝑗−)) where, 𝑆𝑖 and 𝑅𝑖 , represent the utility measure and the regret measure, respectively, and 𝑤𝑗 is the weight of the jth criterion, expressing the relative importance of each criterion. 𝑤𝑗 can be calculated by AH P or Entropy method. Step 6: Computation of VIKOR index (𝑄𝑖) for ith alternative by the following relation: 𝑄𝑖=𝑣(𝑆𝑖−𝑆−)(𝑆∗−𝑆−)+(1−𝑣)(𝑅𝑖−𝑅∗)(𝑅∗−𝑅−) where: 𝑄𝑖 represents the ith alternative VIKOR valu e, 𝑖=1,2,3,…𝑚; 𝑆∗=max𝑖𝑆𝑖 , 𝑆−=min𝑖𝑆𝑖 𝑅∗=max𝑖𝑅𝑖 , 𝑅−=min𝑖𝑅𝑖 where “𝑣” denotes: weight of the maximum group utility. It ranges between 0 and 1, and is based on the level of compromise a mong decision makers. The higher the term 𝑣, the compromise is greater. In most cases, it is to be set to 0.5 ( 𝑣 =0.50). Step 7: Rank the alternatives, sorting by the values S, R and Q, from the minimum value to the maximum. The results are three rankin g lists. European Journal of Science and Technology e-ISSN: 2148 -2683 505 Step 8: Ranking list by the measure Q (m inimum) is proposed if the following two conditions are satisfied: C1) Alternative 𝐴1 must also be the best ranked by S or/and R C2) Acceptable advantage: 𝑄(𝐴2)−𝑄(𝐴1)≥𝐷𝑄 ; where DQ=1/(m -1); m is the number of alternatives. 3. Research Findings and Discussions After MCDM methods application has been determined to deal with and avoid risks, it can be easily set up production planning according to obtained results. Agricultural risk analysis co mes up with benefits of productivity and easiness of planning. Since Turkey has larger agricultural lands than lots of countries, productivity and planning should be considered properly. In this point advantages of AHP and VIKOR can be seen and agricultura l strategy of Turkey can be revised. Optimization of agricultural lands with proper agricultural goods could increase significantly export of Turkey among other countries. More research and development studies should be done and implemented systematically in the agricultural area. In this study agricultural productivity and planning problem is considered and MCDM method based structure have been proposed . For the future work, more detailed and specific product group base criteria set and detailed risk analy sis could be applied to increase total number of value added agricultural products in Turkey. 4. Results AHP and VIKOR are two important MCDM methods and applied in order to find each agricultural risk analysis criteria to increas e productivity. Criteria s are defined and found with the help of 8 experienced agricultural engineers a) Unit domestic price of product b) Unit export price of product c) Export demand of product d) Domestic demand of product e) Local value of product f) Global value of product g) Unit cost of production of product In this study each of criteria weights have been found with using AHP and ranking and prioritization of alternatives have bee n done with the help of VIKOR method. In Figure 4 AHP application interface can be seen. In Figure 5 AHP Ap plication on Superdecision Program interface for this problem can be seen too. Figure 4.

Abstract In this work, shielding parameters of LAS (lithium -aluminum -silicate) Li 2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 glass samples have been reported with the help of the WinXCom code, a Windows version of the XCOM database . The effect of increasing P2O5 concentration on the shielding parameters has been examined in the used Li 2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 glass samples . The shielding effectuality of the materials for gamma -ray can be interpreted with the help of several different attenuation parameters which plays key role in understanding the shielding capabilities of the material. The mass attenuation coefficient, defined by 𝜇𝑚=𝜇/𝜌, is the most basic coefficient used to calculate the shielding parameters. These parameters are the mean f ree path (MFP), half value layer (HVL), tenth value layer (TVL), effective electron number (N e) and equivalent atomic number (Z eq). The exposure buildup factor (EBF) and GP fitting parameters are also calculated by the method of logarithmic interpolation using Z eq of a Li2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 glass system. The EBF values for Li2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 glass samples show an inverse relation with Ne. Further, P1 (least Ne) offers maximum values of EBF and P6 (highest Ne) offers minimum EBF values. The change in different shiel ding parameters for the selected glasses was interpreted by considering three interactions with the substance (Photoelectric effect, Compton scattering and pair production). The obtained results show that the 𝜇𝑚 strongly depends on the photon energy, che mical composition and density of the shielding materials. It is clear to see that P6 glass sample having the highest P2O5 concentration is the most effective glass sample among the other glasses of Li 2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 system in nuclear radiation shielding ability .

Introduction Ionizing radiation s such as gamma -ray and x -ray are widely used in different fields such as medical, industrial and nuclear medicine [1]. The main idea in radiation protection is to know tolerable doses and to prevent radiation workers and the surrounding population from taking doses above it. The obstacle to be placed between the radiation source and the person will minimize the dose take n. The armor chosen for the different types of radi ation must be different. The higher the material density and atomic number , the more protective it is against radiation [2]. Radiation protection refers to the principle of ALARA, known as As Low As Reasonably Achievable which means , it is necessary to adm inister a minimum dose which is reasonable. ALARA principle is applied according to three basic parameters; time (as little time as possible), distance (as far as possible) and shielding [3,4]. The calculation of radiation shielding depends on the type of radiation source, the location and energy dependence of the radiation, the mechanisms of radiation interaction with matter, and the determination of secondary radiation sources released as a result of the interaction of radi ation [5]. Many properties of th is material need to be studied to select the material to be used to reduce the effect of photon radiation. For this purpose, the linear attenuation coefficients (µ) of the substances are examined as a measure of the absorption of a photon by the subs tance. The linear attenuation coefficient gives the possibility of a photon passing any interaction per unit length; it is the sum of the possibilities of photoelectric attenuation (τ), Compton scattering (σ) and double formation (κ). Today, the majority of thes e materials are made of lead and lead -containing composites; however, lead has some disadvantages. First of all, these materials are heavy and this may cause some negligence in their use. On the other hand, the toxic effect of lead used in these materials and the fact that the lead has a brittle structure shortens the service life of the protective material [6]. In order to overcome this disadvantageous situation, the demand for glass materials as alternative materials is increasing [7-11]. Glass -ceramic materials have the same chemical composition as glass, but have a different structure from them. That is, typically 95 -98% by volume is c rystalline, while a small percentage is glassy. Glass ceramic materials are typically characterized by certain properties. Some of those; high power, low -even sometimes negative thermal expansion coefficient, high impact resistance, good resistance to ther mal shock, and a range of optical properties. LAS (Li 2O-Al2O3-SiO 2), a combination of lithium aluminum silicate, is one of the most valuable and widely used glass -ceramic systems. This glass system has a wide range of useful features such as low thermal ex pansion coefficient (TEC), excellent mechanical properties and high thermal shock resistance [12-14]. It is an important step to add different nucleating agents (such as oxides) to reduce the crystallization temperature of glass -ceramic materials and limit the tendency to convert. The nucleating agents used repeatedly are ZrO 2 and TiO 2 oxides [15 -16]. In addition, the effect of the use of P 2O5 oxides, known as high moisture absorbing and small crystalline glass maker s such as boric oxide and silicon dioxide , has been particularly investigated in LAS glass ceramics. Also, the glass -ceramic sample contains a small amount of MgO to reduce the melting point and a low concentration of lithium to reduce the cost of the material. Among the various types of oxides, phosphorus pentoxide (P 2O5) known as highly hygroscopic and microcrystalline glass network former like boric oxide and silicon dioxide. On the other hand, P2O5 can be doped with rare earth and metals to manufacture special glasses such as medical implants for insoluble acid -resistance as well as for radiation shielding [17]. In this study, it is aimed to observe the nuclear radiation shielding properties of P 2O5 additive on LAS (lithium -aluminum -silicate) glasses. In order to interpret these properties, se veral gamma -ray shielding parameters have been identified with exposure buildup factor (EBF) for five LAS glass samples with different P 2O5 doped [18]. In this study, the WinXCom program was used to determine the mass attenuation coefficients of glass samples [19]. Other important gamma ray shielding parameters were calculated by using mass attenuation coefficients obtained by the WinXCom program. These parameters are, mean free path (MFP), half value layer (HVL), tenth value layer (TVL), effective electron number (N e) and exposure buildup factor (EBF), respectively. Table 1 shows the density and molar percentages of P 2O5 doped Lithium Aluminum Silicate (LAS) glass samples. The results from recent studies may provide a better understanding of the effect of the P 2O5 additive on nuclear radiation shielding, and may also bring a different perspective to research on P 2O5 oxide.

Material and Method 2.1. Win XCom Program Theoretically calculated mass attenuation coefficient values are given as tables in the study conducted by Hubbell and Seltzer [ 20]. A suitable alternative method for manual calculations is to generate the attenuation data required by the computer. The tables in the above -mentioned study are used for these calculations. With this in mind, Berger and Hubbell [ 21] improved a computer program called XCOM for the calculation of attenuation coefficients and cross -sections for any element, mixture or compound in the energy region of 1 keV -100 GeV . There have been a number of updates to this program since then, and now a web version is also available. Lately , this well-known and widely used program has been adapted by Gerward et al. Into the Windows infrastructure, and the Windows version is called WinXCom [22,25]. 2.2. Calculation method of shielding parameters The 𝜇𝑚=μ/ρ (mass attenuation coefficient) coefficient is a non -density -dependent coefficient and is calculated according to the law of Lambert -Beer for the attenuating materials examined. 𝜇𝑚𝑥=ln (𝐼𝐼0) (1) where 𝐼0,𝐼 and x are the incident photon intensity, attenuated pho ton intensity and thickness of the sample , respectively. On the other hand, the 𝜇𝑚 (cm2/g) values of compounds and mixture of different elements are theoretically formulated with the help of the mixture rule [ 26] defined by equation 2. (𝜇𝑚)=∑𝑤𝑖(𝜇𝑚)𝑖 𝑖 (2) where 𝑤𝑖 and are (𝜇𝑚)𝑖 the weight fraction and ma ss attenuation coefficient of the i th element. The 𝜇𝑚value s of the sample glasses might be calculated for specific energy values with the help of the WinXCom program. The e ffective atomic number (Z eff) of the sa mple glasses can be calculated by taking the ratio of the total atomic and electronic cross -sections. 𝑍𝑒𝑓𝑓=𝜎𝑡,𝑎𝜎𝑡,𝑒𝑙=1𝑁𝐴∑𝑓𝑖𝐴𝑖(𝜇𝜌)𝑖𝑖 1𝑁𝐴∑𝑓𝑖𝐴𝑖𝑍𝑖(𝜇𝜌)𝑖𝑖 (3) In the equation 3, the NA is Avogadro constant , 𝑓𝑖 is the fractional abundance of ith element and 𝐴𝑖 is the atomic weight of the ith element. The effective number of electrons is calculated by the following formula. 𝑁𝑒=(𝜇/𝜌)𝜎𝑡,𝑒𝑙=𝑁𝐴𝑍𝑒𝑓𝑓〈𝐴〉 ;〈𝐴〉=𝑀∑𝑛𝑖𝑖 (4) 2.3. Essential theoretical parameters for gamma -ray shielding To describe the radiation shielding efficiency for glass samples the essential theoretical parameters like HVL, TVL and MFP are interpreted for gamma -ray shielding . The HVL, TVL and MFP can be calculated by the mass attenuation coefficient ( 𝜇𝑚) presented in Eq. 5 -6-7; 𝐻𝑉𝐿 =0.693𝜇𝑚𝜌 (5) 𝑇𝑉𝐿 =𝑙𝑛10𝜇𝑚𝜌 (6) 𝑀𝐹𝑃 =1𝜇𝑚𝜌 (7) 2.4. The exposure buildup factor While a single element has the atomic number Z, the compo und materials have the equivalent atomic number (Z eq) and describe the properties of glass systems. The Z eq was used for calculat ing the exposure buildup factors (EBF) and the G -P fitting parameters. 𝑍𝑒𝑞=𝑍1(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑅2−𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑅 )+𝑍2(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑅 −𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑅1)𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑅2−𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑅1 (8) where the R1 and R 2 are the ratio of (m )compton /(m )total and Z1 and Z 2 refer the atomic numbers of the glass samples . G.P fitting parameters (b, c, a, X k, d) for the glass samples were achiev ed by interpolation of equation 8 and detailed calculation procedures can be found from many studies [ 27-30]. Detailed studies on shielding parameter calculations are available [ 31-34]. European Journal of Science and Technology e-ISSN: 2148 -2683 533 3. Results and Discussion Initially, theoretical calculations w as used to compare the 𝜇𝑚 measurement results of the samples. For the calculation , the WinXCom code in the energy r egion of 0.015 MeV -15 MeV were used (can be seen in Table 2 ). The variation of 𝜇𝑚 values according to glass samples can be seen in Figure 1 . The figure shows a quick decrease in the MAC values of the sample glasses to 0.03 MeV . The reason for this is that at low energies, the photon interacts with the substance in relation to Z4/E3.5. Then, as the photon energy value increases, a slower decrease is observed [35-37]. This is because Compton scattering and pair production processes are predominant in medium and high photon energies depending on Z and Z2. Finally, the glass s ample P6 possesses the highest 𝜇𝑚 values among the studied glass es. Table 1.

Low values indicate superior protection ability. As can be seen from Figure s 2 and 3 the P6 glass sample having the highest energy and maximum P2O5 composition was found to reduce MFP, HVL and TVL values of Li2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 glass system and improve the gamma attenuation capacity.

Figure 4 shows the Ne values of Li2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 glass samples that vary with photon energy and elemental composition of glass samples. As can be clearly seen from the figure, the Ne values are highest in the low energy zone and a sudden drop is observed after 0.1 MeV . Ne values slightly increase after 1.022 MeV energy value which is dominated by the pair production process. In addition, Ne values increase with the increase of P2O5 in Li2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 glass system according to Figure 4 the sample P2 has the maximum Ne value among the samples and these values vary between 4.8702 -3.2496 . Figure 4. Effective electron density (N el) of the glass samples with photon energy Variation of equivalent atom numbers Zeq of glass samples for photon energies r egion from 0. 015 MeV to 15 MeV can be seen in Figure 5. With the highest Z eq value, P6 yields the minimum EBF values. The Figure 6 represents the EBF variations of P2 -P3-P4-P5-P6 glass samples at different photon energies using penetration depths 1, 2, 5, 10 mfp. As in the other graphs examined in this study, EBF graphs show the effect of partial photon interactions. When all glass sa mples are taken into consideration, EBF values take the smallest values at low energies. On the other hand, it is beholded that these values are higher in the middle and high energy regions. As can be seen from the Figure 6, the increase and decrease in EBF factors are due to different processes depending on photon energy. However, the heavy elements in the elemental composition of glasses cause an increase in the cross -section values of pair production and lead to the forma tion of more secondary photons. Therefore, especially in high penetration depths, EBF values are increased. Figure 5.

Conclusions In this work, shielding parameters of LAS (lithium -aluminum -silicate) Li 2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 glass system reported with the help of the WinXCom program in the photon energy r egion of 0.015 -15 MeV . We examine the impact of P 2O5 addition on shielding parameters. The shielding effectuality of the materials for gamma ray can be interpreted with the help of several different parameters. These are the mass att enuation coefficient (µ m), mean free path (MFP), half value layer (HVL), tenth value layer (TVL ), effective electron number (Ne), equivalent atomic number (Z eq) and exposure buildup factor (EBF). According to the results, it can be understood clear ly that the P6 glass sample having the highest P 2O5 addition is the most effective glass sample among the other glasses of Li 2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 system in nuclear radiation protection. In addition, when P2O5 contribution increases in Li2O-Al2O3-SiO 2 glass system , the density of glass samples also increases. This suggests that the P6 glass sample in ther present work is useful shielding material for protection from gamma rays. 0,01 0,1 1 1005101520253035EBFPhoton energy (MeV) 1 2 5 10mfpP20,01 0,1 1 1005101520253035mfp 1 2 5 10EBFPhoton energy (MeV)P30,01 0,1 1 1005101520253035 1 2 5 10EBFPhoton energy (MeV)mfpP40,01 0,1 1 1005101520253035mfpEBFPhoton energy (MeV) 1 2 5 10P50,01 0,1 1 1005101520253035 P6mfpEBFPhoton energy (MeV) 1 2 5 10European Journal of Science and Technology e-ISSN: 2148 -2683 537 References 1.

Öz Dünya enerji arzının büyük bir kısmı fosil kaynaklı yakıtlar ile karşılanmakta ve tüm dünyada artan enerji ihtiyacı nedeniyle fosil kaynaklı yakıt talebi gün geçtikçe artmaktadır. Bu enerji ihtiyacının önemli bir kısmı elektrik tüketimi olarak sanayide kul lanılmaktadır. Ülkemizde, sanayide kullanılan elektriğin ise yaklaşık 2/3’ünü endüstriyel cihaz ve ekipmanların vazgeçilmez unsuru olan elektrik motorları tarafından tüketilmektedir. Bu nedenle, sanayide kullanılan elektrik motorlarının sınıflandırılması, yapılan işe göre verimlerinin takibi, verimsiz motorların teknolojik gelişmelere göre enerji verimli motorlar ile değiştirilmesi yoluyla yapıl acak enerji tasarrufu Türkiye ’nin enerjide dışa bağımlılığının azaltılması açısından büyük önem taşımaktadır. Bu ç alışmada, bir gıda fabrikasının üretim hattında kullanılan elektrik motorları motor gücü, güç faktörü, çalışma süresi, motor verimi ve yıllık enerji tüketim miktarları dikkate alınarak sınıflandırılmıştır. Alınan veriler işletmenin çalışma şartları göz önü nde bulundurularak değerlendirilmiş ve verimlilikleri düşük olan mevcut elektrik motorları yerine daha verimli motorların kullanılması durumunda elde edilebilecek t asarruf miktarı hesaplanmıştır. Elde edilen sonuçlara göre bu enerji verimliliği uygulaması için basit geri ödeme süresinin 1,5 yıldan daha kısa olacağı hesaplanmıştır. Ayrıca mevcut ve önerilen elektrik motorlarının CO 2 emisyon miktarları analiz edilmiştir. Verimlilik sınıfı yüksek elektrik motorlarının kullanılması durumunda %12,15 oranında CO 2 salınımının azalacağı ve çevreye olan zararlı gaz salınımının düşeceği belirlenmiştir .

Analysis of Efficiency and CO 2 Emission for Electric Motors; Example of a Food Factory Abstract Most of the world energy supply is met by fossil fuels, and the demand for fossil fuels is increasing day by day due to the i ncreasing energy demand in the world. A significant portion of this energy need is used in industry as electricity consumption. In our country, about 2/3 of the electricity used in industry is consumed by electric motors which are indispensable elements of industrial d evices and equipments. Therefore, electric motors used in industry are classified and the inefficient engines should b e replaced with energy efficient motors. By this way, energy saving could be achieved in terms of reduction of external dependence on Turkey's energy.

The data obtained were evaluated by considering the ope rating conditions of the enterprise and the saving amount which could be obtained in cas e of using more efficient motors instead of the existing electric motors with low efficiency was calculated. According to the results, it was calculated that the simple payback perio d for this energy efficiency application would be shorter than 1.5 years. In addition, the CO 2 emissions of current and recommended electric motors have been analyzed. In the case of the use of high efficiency electric motors, it is determined that CO 2 emission will be decreased by 12.15% and the emission of harmful gas to the e nvironment will decrease .

Giriş Enerji hem endüstri hem de insan yaşamı için vazgeçilmez bir güç haline gelmiştir, bu sebeple dünya enerji arzı gün geçtikçe artmaktadır. Ancak rezerv lerde buna paralel olarak bir artış gözlenmemektedir. Bunun yanı sıra, yapılan hesaplamalar tüketim talebi artış göstermese dahi rezervlerin tükeneceğini belirtilmektedir (Haydaroğlu, 2006 ). Dünyamızdaki fosil yakıt kaynaklarının sınırlı olması ve üretim maliyetlerinin giderek yükselmesi nedeniyle yeni enerji kaynakları arayışının yanında var olan enerjinin de verimli kullanılması gerekli hale gelmiştir. Aşırı enerji tüketiminin hava kirliliği, küresel iklim değişikliği, asit yağmuru ve solu num yolu hastal ıkları gibi olumsuz etkilere yol açtığı bilinmektedir. Bu nedenlerle birlikte, enerji maliyetlerinin artması ve özellikle ser a gazı emisyonlarının azaltılması yönünde çevre bilincinin artması nedeniyle enerji verimliliği uygulamaları daha önemli hale gelmi ştir (Ener Ruşen ve ark. , 2018a ). Enerji; ülkelerin ekonomik girdilerinde önemli bir yer tutmakta ve dünya siyaset politikasını önemli oranda etkilemesinin dış ında iklim değişikliğinde de önemli etkilere sebep olduğundan ekonomik, sosyal ve coğrafik olara k da dünya düzeninin en etkin belirleyicisi konumundadır (Herring , 2000 ; TMMOB, 2012 ). Uluslararası Enerji Ajansı ’ndan (IEA) elde edilen veriler 1970 -2016 yılları arasında dünya enerji tüketimindeki artışın yaklaşık 2 katına çıktığını göstermiştir. Buna paralel olarak, son 12 yılda ülkemizdeki elektrik enerjisi tüketimi de ikiye katlanmıştır (IEA, 2016). Yapılan çalışmalarda, enerji tüketiminin genel olarak artmasıyla birlikte fosil kaynak tüketimi ve atmosfere salınan karbondioksit (CO 2) miktarının da ön emli oranda arttığı ve oluşan sera etkisinin dünya genelinde iklim değişikliklerine sebep olduğu belirtilmiştir (Brannlund ve ark., 2007; Esen, 2015 ). 21. yüzyılda yaşanan teknolojik gelişmeler ile birlikte insan yaşamı daha konforlu hale gelmiş ve bununla birlikte enerji tüketimi de artış göstermiştir. Ayrıca, dünya nüfusunun artışı da enerji tüketimi üzerinde önemli etkisi olan parametrelerdendir (Perez -Lombard ve ark., 2007; Doğan & Yılankırkan , 2015 ). Bu teknolojik gelişmeler madencilik, metal, kimya, kâğıt, gıda vb. farklı sanayi sektörlerindeki endüstriyel uygulamaların dünya çapında yaygınlaşmasını tetiklemiş ve buna bağlı olarak sanayi sektörlerindek i enerji tüketimini arttırmıştır. Sanayideki enerji tüketiminin toplam enerji tüketimi içinde % 37’sinden ve CO 2 emisyonlarının % 36’sından sorumlu olduğu bilinmektedir (Ener Ruşen ve ark., 2018b ). Sanayide kullanılan elektriğin ise yaklaşık 2/3’ü elektrik enerjisini mekanik enerjiye dönüştürmek için önemli bir role sahip olan elektrik motorları tarafında n tüketilmektedir. Dünya genelinde sektörel bazda elektrik motorlarının kullanım oranları Şekil 1’de verilmiştir. Böylesine yüksek elektrik tüketimi nedeniyle, ülkeler yüksek enerji verimli elektrik motorları üzerine çalışmalar yapmakta ve projeler gelişti rerek elektrik motorları kullanımında enerji tasarrufu sağlamayı amaçlamaktadırlar (TMMOB Makina Mühendisleri Odası , 2012; Cagnoa ve ark., 2019; Triannia ve ark., 2019). Şekil 1. Elektrik motorlarının sektörlere göre enerji kullanım oranları (Waide & Brunner, 2011 ) Özellikle pompa, fan ve kompresörlerde olmak üzere birçok endüstriyel cihaz ve ekipmanlarda elektrik motorları farklı tip ve kapasitelerde sıklıkla kullanılmaktadır. Güç üretmek için elektrik enerjisi kullanmakta olan motorun ürettiği mekanik gücün, şebeke veya sistemden çekilen elektrik enerjisine oranı motor verimi olarak tanımlanmaktadır. Gün ümüzde kullanılan elektrik motorlarının % 90’ını asenkron motorlardır, bu sebeple sanayide asenkron motorların kayıplarının azaltılarak yüksek verime sahip motorlar kulla nılması önem arz etmektedir (Ener Ruşen ve ark., 2018b ). Asenkron motorlarda meydana g elen temel kayıp güçler; i) Sürtünme ve rüzgâr kayıpları, ii) Demir kayıpları, iii) Stator iletken (bakır) kayıpları, iv) Rotor iletken (alüminyum) kayıpları, v) Ek kayıpla rdır (Bodur , Avrupa Bilim ve Teknoloji Dergisi e-ISSN: 2148 -2683 566 2011 ). Bu motorların kayıplarının tahmini ve verimlilikleri hakkında güncel çalışma lar mevcuttur (Santos ve ark., 2019; Chuang ve ark., 2019). Avrupa Elektrik Makineleri Üreticileri Komitesi ’ne (CEMEP) göre elektrik motorlarını verimlilikleri açısından EFF1 (en yüksek verimli motorlar), EFF2 (verimlilikleri artırı lmış motorlar) ve EFF3 (verimlilikleri düşük motorlar) olmak üzere 3 sınıfa ayırmak mümkündür (T.C. Bilim, Sana yi ve Teknoloji Bakanlığı, 2015) . Bu motorlar kullanım alanlarına göre şu şekilde seçilirler; • EEF1 Sınıfı: sürekli çalışan fan, pompa gibi uygu lamalar için • EEF2 Sınıfı: sık kullanımı olan makine -ekipman uygulamalarında, • EEF3 Sınıfı: seyrek kullanılan ya da gerektiğinde devreye alınan makine uygulamalarında, tercih edilebilir (Bodur , 2011 ). Bu çalışmada, Karaman ilinde bulunan bir hazır gıda fabrikasında elektrik enerjisinin tüketiminde çok önemli bir paya sahip olan elektrik motorlarının verimlilik sınıfları incelenmiştir. EFF3 sınıfı motorların çoğunlukta olduğu tespit edilmiştir. EFF3 sı nıf motorların yüksek verimli EFF1 sınıf elektrik moto rları ile değiştirilmesi durumunda tüketilen enerji farkı, buna bağlı olarak elde edilecek tasarruf miktarı ve yaklaşık yatırım maliyeti ile geri ödeme süresi hesaplamaları yapılmıştır. 2. Materyal ve Metot Sanayide kullanılan elektrik motorlarında ve uyg ulamalarında verimlilik sağlayarak enerji tasarrufu elde etmenin temel yolları olarak aşağıdaki seçenekler sıklıkla önerilmektedir (Bodur , 2011 ); 1. Yüksek verimli motor kullanmak: EFF3 olarak adlandırılan düşük verim sınıflı motorlar yerine, EFF1 yüksek verimli veya EFF2 verimi iyileştirilmiş olarak adlandırılan motorlar kullanarak enerji tasarrufu sağlamak bilinen en yaygın yöntemdir. 2. Doğru motor seçimi: Kullanım yeri ve motorun mekanik gücünün doğru kullanıldığından emin olunması gerekir. İşletmelerin kurulumu sırasında gelecekte iş kapasitesinin arttırılabileceği düşüncesiyle ihtiyacından daha yüksek güce sahip motorların a lınması hem yatırım ma liyetini artırmakta hem de daha yüksek güç/enerji harcanmasına sebep olmaktadır. 3. Enerji tasarrufu fizibilitesi: İşletme içerisinde kullanılan motorların termal kamera ve enerji analizörü ile sürekli takibin in yapılması ve bakımlarının aksatılmaması, g erekli görüldüğü durumlarda enerji fizibilitesi yapılarak düşük verimli motorların yüksek verimli olanlar ile değiştirilmesi gerekir. 4. Değişken Hızlı AC motor sürücüleri kullanmak: Asenkron motorun besleme kaynağının istenilen hızda dönmesi sağlayan bir elektronik sürücü devresi kullanılarak motorun hız kontrolü sağlanabilmektedir. Böylece elektrik motorları ile yapılacak işle min üretkenliği ve verimliliği artırılmış olacaktır. 5. Motoru besleyen Elektrik Enerjisi Kalitesi: Motora gereken gerilim değerin i doğru vermek, aşırı yüksek ve düşük gerilim vermemek, Elektrik tesisatının gereken yeterlilikte olmasını sağlamak (Uzun hatlar, motor yük değişiminden gerilim dalgalanma sı, yanlış hat kesiti) Fosil kaynaklı yakıtların yanması sonucunda açığa çıkan CO 2 temel sera gazı olarak kabul edilmektedir. CO 2 salınımının artmasıyla beraber atmosferde ısı geçişleri artmaktadır. İncelenen işletmede elektrik motorlarının düşük verim sınıflı motorlar olduğu t espit edilmiştir. Bu motorların kullanılması sonucunda oluşacak CO 2 emisyonu ve yerine kullanılması önerilen yüksek verim sınıflı motorların kullanılması sonucunda oluşacak CO 2 emisyonu hesaplanmıştır. Elektrik enerjisinin tüketilmesi sonucunda her kWh elektrik başına IPCC -Hükümetler Arası İklim Değişikliği Paneli ’nde (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 0.5 ile 0.6 arası bir çarpan değeri belirlemiştir. Hesaplamamızda ortalama olması açısından 0.55 değeri kullanılmıştır ) (Pabuçcu ve Bayramoğlu, 2016 , Özbudak ,2011 ). İşletmede yer alan motorların özellikleri, adetleri, motor verimleri, tükettikleri enerji değerleri ve yıllık CO 2 salınım değerleri hesaplanarak Tablo 1’de sunulmuştur. Tablo 1.

Bu sebeple, işl etmenin farklı birimlerinde yer alan ve değişik etiket değerlerine sahip verimlilik değeri düşük (EFF3) olan elektrik motorlarını n tam yükteki durumları incelenmiştir. Hesaplanan değerler Tablo 1’de sunulmuştur. 3. Araştırma Sonuçları ve Tartışma Bu çalışmada, verimlilik sınıfı EFF3 olan verimsiz motorların teknolojik gelişmeler neticesinde ulaşılmış yüksek enerji verim li motorlar (EFF1 sınıfı) ile değiştirilmesi durumu incelenmiştir. Avrupa Elektrik Makineleri Ü reticileri Komitesi ’ne (CEMEP) ( T.C. Bilim, Sana yi ve Teknoloji Bakanlığı, 2015) göre asenkron motor verimliliklerinde motor çıkış gücüne göre verim oranı 0,83 ile 0,95 arasında değişmektedir. İşletmede yer alan EFF3 tip motorların sahip olduğu çıkış gücü değişimine göre önerilen EFF1 elektrik motorlarının özellikleri ve yıllık CO 2 salınım miktarları Tablo 2’de verilmiştir Tablo 2.

Çalışma kapsamında bu motorların yerine verimleri motor çıkış gücüne göre 0,90’ a kadar ulaşan EFF1 sınıfı verimli motorların kullanılması önerilmiştir. Aynı motor gücü, güç faktörü ve aynı saat çalışma süresine sahip olan EF F1 sınıfı verimli motorların kullanılmas ı durumunda yıllık toplam elektrik tüketimi 4 362 892,04 kW ’ olarak hesaplanmıştır (Tablo 2). Bu iki durum arasındaki Enerji Tüketim (ET) farkı; (ETEFF 3) – (ETEFF 1) = (4 966 156,80 kW) – (4 362 892,04 kW) = 603 264,76 kW (1) Karaman organize sanayi bölgesinde elektrik birim fiyatı 0,33 TL/ kWh olarak alınmaktadır. Bu durumda elektrik enerjisinden e lde edilecek tasarruf miktarı: Tasarruf Miktarı = ( 603 264.76 kW) * ( 0,33 TL/ kWh) = 199 077,33 TL (2) olarak bulunmuştur (1 $ = 4.8357 TL). Fabrikadaki mevcut EFF3 sınıfı elektrik motorlarının EFF1 sınıfı motorlar ile değiştirilmesi durumunda toplam motor maliyeti belirlenerek geri ödeme süresini denklem 3 kullanılarak hesaplanmaktadır. Geri ödeme sü resi = Masraf / Kazanç (3) Bu durumda EFF1 sınıfı elektrik motorları kullanılması durumunda önerilen elektrik motorları Tablo 3’te verilmektedir. Tablo 3.

Bu çalışma kapsamında incelenen gıda fabrikasında 24 saat kesintisiz üretim yapıldığından elektrik motorları için yıllık 7200 saat çalışma durumu baz alınmıştır. Ancak, kısa süreli çalışma yapılan herhangi bir proseste verimli motor (EFF1) kullan ılsa bile bunun sağlayacağı fayda (tasarruf) düşük kalacağından motorun kendini amorti etmesi süresi çok uzun olacaktır. Bu durumda, yatırım maliyetleri göz önüne alınarak hesaplanacak olan basit geri ödeme süresine bakılmalıdır. Basit geri ödeme süresinin 5 yıldan uzun olduğu durumlar çoğunlukla tercih edilmemektedir. Ayrıca işletmede önerilen EFF1 sınıfı verimli motorların kullanılması durumu ile hâlihazırda var olan EFF3 sınıfı verimsiz motorların kullanılması durumu CO 2 salınımı miktarları hesaplanarak karşılaştırılmıştır (Şekil 2). Şekil 2’de EFF3 sınıfı verimsiz motorların yerine a ynı motor gücü, güç faktörü ve aynı saat çalışma süresine sahip olan EFF1 sınıfı verimli elektrik motorlarının kullanılması durumunda oluşacak CO 2 salınımı miktarlarının motor sayısı arttıkça daha fazla oranda azaldığı gözlenmiştir. Yıllık toplam CO 2 salın ımı miktarları önerilen EFF1 motorlarda 2399,59 Ton/yıl ve hâlihazırda kullanılan EFF3 sınıfı verimsiz motorlarda ise 2731,38 Ton/yıl olarak hesaplanmıştır. Buna göre EFF1 sınıfı verimli elektrik motorlarının kullanılması durumunda bu gıra fabrikasınd a %12 ,15 oranında CO 2 salınımının azalacağı ve çevreye olan zararlı gaz salınımının düşeceği belirlenmiştir. Şekil 2. EFF1 sınıfı verimli motor EFF3 sınıfı verimsiz motorların kullanılması durumu CO 2 salınımı miktarları 4. Sonuç Ülkemizin hem hızla büyüyen hem de nüfusu hızla artan bir ülke olduğu dikkate alındığında konut ve sanayi sektöründe her geçe n gün enerji talebinin ciddi bir şekilde artış göstereceği aşikârdır. Bu enerji artışındaki talebi karşılamak için yeni enerji kayn aklarının arayışıyla birlikte mevcut kaynakların planlı bir şekilde kullanılması önem arz etmektedir. Bu sebeple, var olan enerji kayna kları en verimli şekilde kullanılarak ülkemiz enerji kaynaklarının daha uzun yıllar kullanılabilmesine olanak sağlanmalıd ır. Sanayi sektöründe yoğun olarak kullanılan elektrik enerjisinin iletim ve dağıtımından elektrik motorları gibi kullanıldığı cihaz ve ekipmanlara kadar tüm enerji kayıpları ilgili ölçüm cihazları ile tespit edilerek olası kayıplar için gerekli önlemler a lınmalıdır. Bu şekilde elektriksel kayıplardan ciddi oranlarda enerji tasarrufları elde edilmiş olur. Ayrıca, insanlığın geleceği ve refahı için en önemli noktalardan biri olan enerji verimliliği bilinci milli bir politika olarak hayatın her alanına yerleş melidir. Bunun için enerji verimliliği konusunda nitelikli personel sayısının arttırılarak toplumun her kesimde bu bilincin oluşması sağlanmalıdır. Bu çalışmada, Karaman organize sanayi bölgesinde faaliyet gösteren bir hazır gıda üretim fabrikasının bir ün ite üretim hattında kullanılan elektrik motorlarının verimlilik sınıfları ve CO 2 salınım miktarları incelenmiştir. Fabrikada kullanılan elektrik motorlarının sayısı, motor gücü, güç faktörü, çalışma süresi, motor verimi ve yıllık enerji tüketimi açısından değerlendirilmiş ve sınıflandırılmıştır. Verimleri düşük mevcut elektrik motorları yerine önerilmekte olan verimli motorların kullanılması durumunda elde edilecek tas arruf miktarı hesaplanmıştır. Sonuç olarak, yapılan hesaplamalara göre, fabrikada bulunan EFF3 sınıfı verimsiz elektrik motorlar ile EFF1 sınıfı verimli elektrik motorların değiştirilmesi durumunda tesis elektrik enerjisinden yıllık 200.000 TL ’ye varan bir tasarruf sağlamış olacaktır. Hesaplamalar European Journal of Science and Technology e-ISSN: 2148 -2683 569 sonucunda bu değişimin geri ödeme süresi yaklaş ık olarak 1,32 yıl olarak bulunmuştur. Yapılacak olan bu enerji tasarrufu aynı zamanda tesisin CO 2 salınımının da ciddi miktarda azalmasını sağlamaktadır. İşletmede hâlihazırda kullanılan EFF3 sınıfı verimsiz motorların yerine aynı motor gücü, güç faktörü ve aynı saat çalışma süresine sahip olan EFF1 sınıfı verimli elektrik motorlarının kullanılması önerilerek oluşan CO 2 salınımı miktarlarının %12,15 oranında azaldığı hesaplanmıştır.

Modelling and Optimizing Microwave -Assisted Extraction o f Antioxidants From Burdock ( Arctium Lappa ) Using Responce Surface Methodology Abstract Burdock (Arctium lappa L.) is a commercially an important plant often used in traditional medicine. The optimum operating conditions of microwave -assisted extraction (MAE) including temperature (X1), extraction time (X2), solvent concentration (X3) and solid to solvent ratio (X4) were ascertained by employing response surface methodology (RSM). The total antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content of burdock leaves extracts were investigated by CUPRAC and Folin assays respectively. A second -order polynomial model was found to be the best model that describes TAC and TPC of yield, and all models calculated for the two responses were found significant (p<0.0001). It was observed that the values of TAC and TPC varied between 0.046 – 0.185 mmol TR / g DS, 0.303 - 0.722 mmol TR / g DS, respectively.

Burdock commonly used as a traditional medicinal plant because of its beneficial effects related to inflammatory disorders such as arteriosclerosis, gout, hepatitis. Burdock has anti – inflammatory, anti -mutagenic, anti -aging properties due t o its rich antioxidant content (Chen et al 2004 ). Ionescu et al (2013) investigated the antimicrobial activity of some hydroalcoholic extracts of burdock and reported it s antimicrobial activity against the bacterial strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Ferracane et al (2010) analyzed the bioactive metabolic profile of burdock seeds, leaves and roots by liquid chromatography coupled to elecrospray tandem mass spectr ometry. Caffeic acid, arctiin, chlorogenic acid, cynarin, luteolin and quercitrin were found in burdock extracted through sonication at room temperature for 30 min. In another study, Lou et al (2010) performed UPLC - MS/MS analysis of burdock leaves and det ect ten different active compounds such as luteolin, caffeic acid, rutin, benzoic acid, quercetin, quercitrin, chlorogenic acid, cynarin, p -coumaric and arctiin. In literature, several studies have been investigated the total phenolic content and free radi cal scavenging activity of different parts of burdock (roots, leaves and seeds) by using varied extraction techniques. Rodriguez et al (2018) determined composition and antioxidant activity of burdock root extracts by using classical extraction and supercr itical fluid extraction. Jimenez -Zamor a et al (2016) determined the antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content of 36 plants including burdock consumed in Spain as infusion. Lin et al (1996) determined the hydroxyl and superoxide radical scavenging act ivity of burdock extract by using an electron spin resonance spectrometer. Milani et al (2011) optimized conventional and ultrasound -assisted extraction of inulin from burdock root using responce surface methodology. RSM is a statistical analysis of data for evaluate multiple parameters and their interactions. Thus, the optimization of processing parameters can be easily achieved, keeping the numb er of experiments to a minumum (Sun et al 2014 ). As far as is known , optimization of microwave - assis ted extr action of antioxidant compounds from burdock using RSM has not been studied in the literature . In this study, preparation of burdock leaves extracts for analysis was performed using MAE, which has distinct advantages ove r conventional extraction methods. MAE reduced extraction time and solvent volume as compared to conventional extraction method. The reproducibility and recovery parameters are better compared to the classical extraction method. Moreover, this method is highly suitable for the extraction of small molecule phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, quercetin, isoflavin and resveratrol since these molecules are stable at microwave heating conditions up to 100° C for 20 minutes (Azwanida 2015) . The maximum extraction yield was obtained by optim ization of operational parameters affecting extraction efficiency such as time and temperature using RSM . 2. Materials and M ethods 2.1. Reagent and C hemicals Chemical substances including neocuproine, methanol, ethanol, and Folin - Ciocalteu reagent copper (II) chloride, ammonium acetate, sodium potassium tartarate (NaKC 4H4O6), copper (II) sulfate, sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate were of analytical reagent grade, and obtained from the Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Burdock ( arctium lappa ) was purchased f rom a commercial herb seller (Arifoğlu, Istanbul, Turkey). The burdock leaves was milled into uniform dry powder by grinder and stored at 4 °C. 2.2. Instrumentation ETHOS - One (Milestone) extraction system was used to extraction of burdock leaves. UV - visible spectra and absorp tion measurements were achieved by using Varian CARY 100 UV - Vis spectrophotometer. The MAE of antioxidants from burdock leaves was modelled and optimized by using Design -Expert® Software Version 11 Trial. 2.3. Microwave - Assisted Extraction of Burdock Thirty experimental MAE runs were carried out on different temperatures (50 -100 °C), solvent concentration (ethanol % in water), extraction time (1 - 10 min) and solid to solvent ratio (g/ 20mL). In each experimental run, varying quantities sample (0.1-0.4 g) was mixed with varying quantities 20 mL aqueous ethanol solution (0 %, 50 % , 100 % (v / v)) in an inner vesse l. The microwave power (500 - 1500 W) was automatically controlled by a system in the oven according to temperature in of the oven. Extraction of antioxidants from burdock leaves under optimal experimental conditions was performed with using MAE system as fol lows: 0.21 g of burdock leaves in 20 mL of 21.7 % aqueous ethanol solutions were added to the Teflon vessel. Burdock leaves sample in solvent was irradiated with microwaves 3 min for heating to the 90 °C and, kept there for 6.0 min, and 5 min for cooling. The extracts cooled to room temperature were filtered through 0.45 micron membrane filters. The extracts preserved in a refrigerator until use. Three replicate extractions were obtained from the burdock leaves and spectrophotometric measurements of each e xtract were repeated three times. European Journal of Science and Technology e-ISSN: 2148 -2683 657 2.4. Determination of Total Phenolic C ontent (TPC) Folin -Ciocalteau assay was applied to determine TPC values of the burdock leaves extract (Singleton et al 1999) . The reagents which were used in Folin - Ciocalteau assay were as follow: Lowry C reagent was freshly prepared as mixture of 50 mL Lowry A solution (2 % Na 2CO 3 in 0.1 M NaOH) and 1 mL Lowry B solution (0.5 % CuSO 4 in 1% NaKC 4H4O6). 2.5 mL of Lowry C solution , x μL of the burdock leaves extract, and (1 - x) mL H 2O were added in a test tube and allowed to stand at room temperature for ten minutes . Finally 0.25 mL of Folin reagent was add ed, and absorbance wa s measured at 750 nm after 30 min. 2.5. Determination of Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) CUPRAC assay was applied to determine TAC values of the burdock leaves (Apak et al 2004) . 1 mL each of CuCl 2 (10 mM), neocuproine (7.5 mM), pH = 7 ammoni um acetate solution (1 M ) and x mL of the burdock leaves extract were added to test tube in this order. A cupric neocuproine complex (Cu (II) - Nc) was reduced to the cuprous chelate in the presence of burdock leaves extract. After 30 min. absorbance of the cuprous chelate was recorded at 450 nm. 2.6. Experimenta l Design Optimizing microwave -assiated extraction of antioxidants from burdock was achieve by using a face - centered composite design (FCCD) which was applie d to the independent parameters. According to equation 1; Y is the dependent variables (response), β0 is an intercept term, k is the factor number , X is the independent variable and ε is experimental error . 𝑌= 𝛽0+∑ 𝛽𝑖 𝑥𝑖 +∑ 𝛽𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑖2 𝑘𝑖=1 +𝑘𝑖=1 ∑ ∑ 𝛽𝑖𝑗 𝑥𝑖 𝑥𝑗 +𝑘𝑗=2𝑘−1𝑖=1 ℇ Eq. (1) In this study, the dependent variables (Y) identify as TPC and TAC , the factor number is 4 (k) and independent variables (X) identify as X 1: temperature, X 2: time X3: ethanol concentration, X 4: solid to solvent ratio. The experimental data indicated that the most suitable model was determined as second order polynomial model for define the values of TPC and TAC as a fu nction of independent variables. The relation between the independent variables and response using Design -Expert program was identified by analysis of ANOVA test. 3. Results and Discussion According to the proposed design, thirty experiments were performed and the experimental values TAC and T PC obtained are shown in Table 1 . It was observed that the values of TAC and TPC varied between 0.046 – 0.185 mmol TR / g DS, 0.303 - 0.722 mmol TR / g DS, respectively.

The adapted quadratic models for TAC and TPC are given in Eqs. (2) – (3), respectively.

(3) The temperature was found to be the most significant operating factor on the extraction efficiency amongst the other factors due to its the highest F -value (751.65) and the smaller p -value ( < 0.0001 ). Table 2 shows results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) which demonstrated the significance and adequacy of developed quadratic models for TAC and TPC. All of the models were found meaningful and adequate to show the correlation between the response and parameters with low p -value ( < 0.0001 for TAC and TPC ) from the ANOVA. The determination coefficient (R2) showing the model's compatibility with the experimental data and the adjusted determination coefficient (Adj. R2) were compatible with each other (the difference is less than 0.2). The predicted R ² of 0.8569 and 0.9515 reasonably agree with the adjusted R ² of 0.9244 and 0.9735 for TAC and TPC, respectively. The a dequate precision which evaluate the signal to noise ratio and is desire d to be greater than 4 were found to be 16.032 and 25.278 for TAC and TPC, respectively.

In the literature, the antioxidant activity of burdock extracts were determined by using different solvents such as water, ethanol, met hanol, chloroform and n -hexane (Duh 1998) . Among the solvents used for extraction, water showed the strongest antioxidant activity compared to extracts prepared with other solvents. In this study the ethanol - water bina ry solvent mixture preferred as an extraction solvent for the extraction process due to its health compatibility, environmentally suitability an d low cost. The usage of aqueous mixtures of alcohols as solvents for the extraction of antioxidants is also kno wn to be more effective than the corresponding single component solvent system and i mproves the extraction rate (Spingo et al 2007, Alonso et al 1991) . Simic et al . (2016) emphasized that ethanol -water binary solvent mixture is widely used for pharmaceutic al and food production due to its low toxicity, environmentally suitability, high extraction yield and health compatibility. Also as shown in Figure 1 , the yields of TAC and TPC increased when ethanol percentage in water decreased up to a certain value. 21 .17 % ethanol concentration showed the greatest efficiency in the extraction of antioxidants from efficiency burdock leaves. Among the studied extraction parameters, time and solid to solvent ratio had the lowest impact on the yields of TAC and TPC. Figure 2 shows that there was no significant change on the yield of TAC and TPC with increasing solid to solvent ratio. The yields of TAC and TPC increased slightly with solid to solvent ratio up to 0.21 g/20 mL solvent. The decrease in the extraction yield afte r a certain solid to solvent ratio is proper with the basis of mass transfer because when a lower solid to solvent ratio is used, the pushing force is expected to be higher ( İlbay et al 2014) . In general, prolonged extraction times increase the extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds because of time required for the solvent to penetrate the solid sample, dissolve the soluble components in the sample, and release the solvent from the sample with the dissolved components (Gan and Latiff 2011, Lee et al 2 006, Fan et al 2008) . However, long extraction times are not economically feasible and need to be optimized. In this study, it was observed that there was no significant change in the efficiency of T AC and TPC with increasing extraction time ( Figure 3) and the extraction time of 6 minutes was sufficient for maximum extraction efficiency. The extraction time of 6 minutes was sufficient for getting t he maximum yield of TAC and TPC. The most important parameters that need to be optimized to reduce the ener gy cost of the extraction process are temperature and time (Spingo et al 2007). The continuous increase in TAC and TPC values of the extracts as a function of temperature can be seen from Figures 1 -3. This can be clarified by the enhancing the solubility o f solute and the di ﬀusion coe ﬃcient with increase of temperatur e as mentioned in many studies ( Shi et al 2003) , In this study, it was observed that the highest efficiency for the extraction of antioxidants from burdock leaves in the range of 80 - 90 oC. In order to prevent structural degradation of phenolics, optimization studies were performed a t maximum 100 degrees C elsius ( Spingo et al 2007, Dent et al 2013, Naczk et al 2004) .

The 3D Surface Plot for the (a) TAC and (b) TPC of the Burdock Leaves Extract As A Function of Temperature to Extraction time (Solvent concentration= 50 % and solid to solvent ratio = 0.25 g / 20 mL ) The optimum MAE conditions for the highest yields of TAC (0.197 mmol TR / g - DS) and TPC (0.722 mmol TR / g - DS) were obtained as follows: 21 % ethanol aqueous solution (v / v), 90 °C, 6.0 min, and 0.21 g/20 mL. The predicted values are compatible with experimental values obtained at optimum extraction conditions. The predicted values for TAC and TPC were calculated as 0 .194 European Journal of Science and Technology e-ISSN: 2148 -2683 661 mmol TR / g – DS and 0.75 mmol TR / g – DS, respectively. As a res ult, the design model was considered to be reliable and accurate for determining TAC and TPC of burdock leaves extracts obtained using microwave assisted extraction. 4. Conclusion Modelling and optimizing microwave -assisted extraction of antioxidants from burdock ( arctium lappa ) using responce surface methodology is the first time in the literature. Response surface methodology was successfully used for the design of experiments, modeling and optimization of the extraction of antioxidant compounds which is the most important step in the determination of the antioxidant capacity of burdock. The optimum extraction conditions for getting t he maximum yield of TAC and TPC were determined. The extraction temperature was found to be the most significant operating factor on the MA E of antioxidants from burdock. These experimental conditions allow a fast, quantitative and maximum extraction of antioxidants from burdock. MAE method optimized in this study can be an important alternative method which can be applied fo r effectively and economically extract antioxidants from burdock in food and pharmaceutical industries in the future.
